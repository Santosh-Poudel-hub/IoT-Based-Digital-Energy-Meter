This project presents an IoT based smart energy meter for real time monitoring of electrical 
energy consumption and automated billing. The system measures key electrical parameters, voltage
and current, using a single phase voltage mutual inductor ZMPT101B and a non invasive AC current 
sensor SCT 013 060. Data from these sensors is transmitted to a cloud platform via an IoT enabled microcontroller
and visualized using the Blynk mobile application. Users can access both real time and historical consumption 
data through the app,enabling efficient energy management and monitoring of usage patterns. The system also generates 
accurate electricity bills automatically,reducing manual effort and minimizing errors. By integrating IoT technology with 
these sensors, the smart meter enhances billing transparency,improves energy efficiency, and supports smart grid 
applications. The solution is cost effective, user friendly, and scalable for both residential and commercial use.
Overall, this IoT enabled smart energy meter provides a reliable and intelligent approach to energy management and optimized resource utilization.
